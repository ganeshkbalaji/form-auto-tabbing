<h1>A simple test to check on a junior developers ability to code in React</h1>

// Implement a component that let's the user type in a month
// and year. The component should use two separate <input> fields,
// one for the month and one for the year. Once the user finishes
// typing two digits into the month input, the cursor should automatically
// move to year input. Each input should have placeholders representing
// the input format (MM/YYYY).
//
// We'd like to start by designing the props of the component, especially geared
// towards component reusability. After that you can start implementing --
// we would like to see as much the component implemented as possible.
//
// Things we're looking for:
// - Usability -- The aesthetics don't need to be perfect, but ease of use
//   and making the component intuitive for the user is important.
// - Code quality - Good code readabliility and general programming style.
// - Reusability -- Assume the component will be re-used in other
//   components and that programmatic ease of use is as important
//   as aesthetic ease of use.
